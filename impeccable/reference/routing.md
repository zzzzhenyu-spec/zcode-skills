# Command guidance

## Workflow questions

Give advice without executing commands; the menu below is only for bare invocations. Consult relevant command references as needed for prerequisites and scope. Link to the [docs](https://impeccable.style/docs/) for the broader workflow guide. If the user also requests execution, follow that request.

## No-argument routing: the context-aware menu

Read this when the user invokes `/impeccable` with no argument. They are asking "what should I do?" Make the menu context-aware instead of static.

Setup has already run `impeccable context`. If that reported `NO_PRODUCT_MD`, the project has no captured context yet: lead the menu with `/impeccable init` as the top recommendation (one line on why) and still show the rest below; don't silently jump into init. Otherwise run `C:\Users\Administrator\.zcode\skills\impeccable\scripts\impeccable.cmd signals` once and read its JSON, then lead with the **2-3 highest-value next commands**, each with a one-line reason pulled from the signals, followed by the full menu (the Commands table in SKILL.md, grouped by category). **Never auto-run a command; the recommendation is a suggestion the user confirms.**

Reason over the signals; there is no score to obey:

- `setup.hasDesign` false while `setup.hasCode` true 鈫?`document` (capture the visual system).
- `critique.latest` is `null` 鈫?the project has never been critiqued; for a set-up project with a real surface, offering `/impeccable critique <surface>` is a strong default.
- `critique.latest` with a low `score` or non-zero `p0` / `p1` 鈫?`polish` (it reads that snapshot as its backlog and closes it when stale or cleared).
- `git.changedFiles` pointing at one surface 鈫?scope `audit` or `polish` to those files specifically, naming them.
- `devServer.running` true 鈫?`live` is available for in-browser iteration, and `generate` for one-shot variant runs on a named element; if false, don't lead with either. **`live`, `generate`, and the bundled `impeccable detect` are web-only.** If `setup.platform` is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`, don't lead with any of them; the browser overlay and the HTML rule engine don't apply to native app code.
- Otherwise group by intent (build new / improve what's there / iterate visually), tailored to the current surface and `setup.platform`.

**If `scan.targets` is non-empty and `setup.platform` is not `ios`/`android`/`adaptive`, run `C:\Users\Administrator\.zcode\skills\impeccable\scripts\impeccable.cmd detect --json <scan.targets joined by spaces>` once** (the bundled detector over local files: no network, no npx; it reads HTML/CSS, so skip it for native projects). `scan.via` tells you what they are: `git-changes` (the markup/style files in your dirty tree, the most relevant set), `source-dir` (e.g. `src`, `app`), `html`, or `root`. Fold the hits into your picks: many quality / contrast hits 鈫?`audit` or `polish`; a specific slop family 鈫?the matching command (gradient text or eyebrows 鈫?`quieter` / `typeset`, flat or gray palette 鈫?`colorize`, and so on). It's a real, current signal that beats guessing. If detect errors or the tree is large and slow, skip it and recommend the user run `audit` themselves; never block the suggestion on it.

Keep it to 2-3 pointed picks with the exact command to type. The menu stays the fallback; the recommendation is the lede.
